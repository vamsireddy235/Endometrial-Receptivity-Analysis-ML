# Endometrial-Receptivity-Analysis-ML
AI-driven Endometrial Receptivity Analysis (ERA) system to optimize embryo transfer timing and improve IVF success rates.


#  Endometrial-Receptivity-Analysis-ML
### AI-based Endometrial Receptivity Analysis for Personalized IVF Success

This project applies machine learning to endometrial gene expression data to predict the optimal embryo transfer window, aiming to increase implantation success rates and reduce IVF failures.


## 🧾 Requirements

To install all dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


Key Features

Predicts optimal implantation window using ML models

Visualizes endometrial gene expression profiles

Compares multiple models (XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, etc.)

Deployable via Streamlit web app for clinicians and researchers

Provides insights for personalized IVF treatment planning


| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| XGBoost             | 0.88     | 0.86      | 0.87   | 0.87     |
| Random Forest       | 0.84     | 0.83      | 0.82   | 0.82     |
| Logistic Regression | 0.79     | 0.78      | 0.77   | 0.77     |


Future Enhancements

Integrate additional biological and lifestyle data
